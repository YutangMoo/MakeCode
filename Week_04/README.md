# Why Create Your Own, When You Can Use Other's (Not really.)

Karen, the coding legend guided us through how to pre-load and use typefaces in our projects.

It's basic but very useful!!!



# Forget About Flash (or Adobe Animate)

The afternoon Karen, still a legend, guided us through how to make animated types.

Because there're delays between the spinning texts and regenerative background that block the texts. the effect is kinda trippy and somehow changed the purity of typeface into geometric element. 



# More GitHubbing

In this section we've leaned a little bit of how to do some basic things using GitHub. Being a rebel, I've decided to use GitHub Desktop (tbh just to see if I can delete folders and stuff) and it worked like a charm!!!!!

# Re-Reading Update

In some out-of-class meetups, we assigned each other tasks in the production team, developed a workable timeline and script, drew up some storyboards, and built some of the sets.

I was in charge of cleaning up the timeline, and work part of the script. In terms of building, I was volunteered to build some of the abstract buildings. 

Hugely inspired by the game I was playing *Control*, I built this abstract hallway, to fit some of the self-narrative of Johnny, which represents that Johnny, affected by Zampano's work, losing himself more and more into the darkness. Take a look:

Thanks Control for inspiring me, truly a stunning game, 10/10 recommended.

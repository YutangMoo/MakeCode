# Why Create Your Own, When You Can Use Other's (Not really.)

Karen, the coding legend guided us through how to pre-load and use typefaces in our projects.

Code:

It's basic but very useful!!!



# Forget About Flash (or Adobe Animate)

The afternoon Karen, still a legend, guided us through how to make animated types.

Code:

Because there're delays between the spinning texts and regenerative background that block the texts. the effect is kinda trippy and somehow changed the purity of typeface into geometric element. 



# More GitHubbing

In this section we've leaned a little bit of how to do some basic things using GitHub. Being a rebel, I've decided to use GitHub Desktop (tbh just to see if I can delete folders and stuff) and it worked like a charm!!!!!

# Re-Reading Update

In some out-of-class meetups, we assigned each other tasks in the production team, developed a workable timeline and script, drew up some storyboards, and built some of the sets.

I was in charge of cleaning up the timeline, and work part of the script. In terms of building, I was volunteered to build some of the abstract buildings. 

Hugely inspired by the game I was playing *Control*, I built this abstract hallway, to fit some of the self-narrative of Johnny, which represents that Johnny, affected by Zampano's work, losing himself more and more into the darkness. Take a look:

Thanks Control for inspiring me, truly a stunning game, 10/10 recommended.

# 01 Types are Just Shapes Put Together

On the magical Google Slides, we gathered in groups and digged a little deeper into the formative of modular types. 

Me as an old-soul decided to do a little research on Ken Garland's modular typeface work on the cover of the *Graphic Handbook*. To me, Ken Garland's work is very easy to duplicate in what I've learnt first week in coding, because the entirity of the typeface were formed with very basic shapes.

I had very little experience in developing typeface using basic geometric shapes, which means Ken Garland's creation really speaks to me:

Using very simple feature to create something visually stunning with systematic structure is kind of my thing.



# 02 Teaming Up

After made up our mind for using Minecraft as our electronic literature platform, me and a few lad formed the first MC team in this studio - thebestMinecrafters.

Group discussion decided we'll be working on The Introduction part of the *House of Leaves*, after which, we made a Google Doc, and started thinking about what should we do next.



# 03 Get Organised

Tech-heads living in China, including me, are very familiar with Github as we are always finding useful resources to bypass some limitations. So when I heard we're using Github to managing and organising our codes, I got very excited because I'm about to become the person who's on the other side of the wall.

We practised, which was lead by Karen of course, to create markdown files which will work as a landing page of the repository, and finally, we all made our own Github Pages.

I'm agreeing with Andy that, as a designer, owning a Github repo of your own is something worth showoff about. I'm already 40% happier.

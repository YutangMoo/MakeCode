# Week 10 

# a.k.a Milestone Review - Coding

Updated for review: https://yutangmoo.github.io/MakeCode/Week_10/New_Floating_Texts/

### What is this?

Sentences from OK Texts by Mark Amerika, broke down, and forming a pseudo-3D style text cloud, which the texts moving around randomly, and bounce back when they hit the edge of the window. 

Also, the cloud reacts to mouse movement.

### What did you do after Week 10's session?

Not much. Added font, modified colour, added two extra layers of texts, with different font size and transparency using a different approach in my version 1, which ensured the randomness of the floating texts.

### What's next?

Meanwhile, I'm figuring out how to make the broken down texts reform into it's original sentences, on a click of a mouse button. Probably need some tutorial lol!

# This Time is For Real - Part 2

I had only one objective this week: fix my botched codes.

In week 9, because I wanted to understand what my code really means, I re-wrote and cleaned up everything, and boom, it's broken.

As shown in the image above, all the texts that should display in order, are stacked together. After night after night of not working it out, I wove the white flag, and yelled "HELP!!!!" to Karen in this session to have my code fixed. 

Luckily, Karen was super eager to help! However her effort of leading me out of the swamp ended with my code overheated both of our computers to their limits, but she fixed the code in a jiffy, as the problem is I "double used" a variant, and caused the program to loop endlessly. 

Happy with the result, I started to "decorate" my code with font and colours, to make it more presentable.

Also using split feature, I added more text into the text cloud, and by creating seperate .js files, cleaned up the code a little bit.

This result was also shown in this week's Milestone Review here:

After the session, I was trying to work out how to make the floating texts form sentences, preferably in an animated fashion.

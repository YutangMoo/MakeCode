# OK.

I first chosen the OK Texts by Mark Amerika as a joke, because it's the shortest and easiest to read. But, settling myself into his work, I've got more and more involved in the "depressionist" aethetic.

Especially because I'm currently reading/listening to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - in the book, there's this robot named Marvin which holds the same attitude as Marks work.

Moreover, being a person who's into systematic thinking and mechanisms, I think Mark's work has its natural quality of being an interactive piece. Reading through his work, I can imagine how it will appear line by line on a computer screen (an old fashioned one), and user can only use very simple input like "click enter to accept" to interact with it.



# Paper Racer!

Game time once more! We were gratefully allowed to play some ~~pirated~~ retro games, and make Paper Prototypes that showcase how the games work live.

Unveiling my second nature: Petrolhead, I went on and made a prototype for Road Fighter (Actually a knocked off version of Road Fighter).

Having old paint brushes and acrylic handy, I've quickly went on to examine how the visual illusion works in the game. Instead of making the car moving forward on a gigantic map that is impossible at the time, the developer cleverly only move the car horizontally, and made a loop of scenery and road playing to create the visual feeling of moving forward.

Using two pieces of white paper as top and bottom boundary, I created a long stretch of scenery and road for the cars to "move" on, and it's simple as that!

As Andy said, the paper prototype really is a fast and easy way to pitch what you had in mind to your stakeholder, especially works as a very rough direct visual representation of what they can expect.

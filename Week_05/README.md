### The Final Hours of [the video above]

Based on the ever crazily expanding storyboard + moodboard + script + everything else document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/19jYVR71h8XhRFNsr-k470x9JxL-L0lmXoieETXrT_1o/edit?usp=sharing), we scratch of sets we need to build, and scenes we need to shoot one by one, and handed them over to our brave film editor Faye and Win for the final touch.

Win, being the crazy one, volunteered himself to do the voiceover of the whole video, which really tied everything together.

I think this film is a very successful and essential experiment for us to familiar ourselves in the world of electronic literature, and the production process was a triumph in teamwork, which all of us were enjoyed a lot.

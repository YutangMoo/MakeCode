# This Time is For Real - Part 1

We shared our paper prototype in class.

Because I've changed direction at the last minute, I decided to use Apple Keynote to quickly make an interactive prototype of the vision I had for the project. And by the look of it, I'm the only one who's making the prototype in a digital space.

# Wiggle Wiggle!

In the afternoon where Karen returns, we step by step followed her on creating Wiggle Texts that will re-generate from a string with mousePressed. And as a bonus, which is quite complex, by simply calling the class letters will generate on canvas by pressing associated key on the keyboard.

I only got to remix the code to make it like a McDonald's commercial lol.

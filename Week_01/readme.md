# Introduction to Machinima

Andy and Karen introduced us into **Task 2** - digital literature and machinima and eased us in in the mini Melbourne in Minecraft EE.

As a (quote/unquote) gamer, I've always found video game as an artform intriguing. In my years of practice (wasting time gaming), I've always eager to look at a more technological layer of game designs.

Good night Virtual Melbourne

The following five weeks, we need to form groups and create a digital cinema piece in a selected video game, based on Mark Z. Danielewski's horror book House of Leaves. 

Excited about the task, I set off to have a bit read of the book, and find out what can I use out of the game's mechanism to build a make-believe world of House of Leaves.



# My Succession in Coding

The second section of the session is when Karen leading us to step by step setting up the IDE and hands-on create a digital canvas and multiple basic shapes by coding in library P5.js. 

Before this studio course, I've had a tiny bit of experience in HTML + CSS coding for web front-end. Working with a more advanced and a completely different language with different syntaxes to me is a big challenge.

By following Karen's patient instruction, I've managed to re-create what she's done, and here it is!

Mixed feeling seeing my code working in a browser window

After getting my hands dirty and write the code line by line, I had some fundamental knowledge of the technology and set off to create my first code-word experiment in a blank new Processing window.

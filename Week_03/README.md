# Wot is Electronic Literature?

After Andy presenting examples of Electronic Literatures, we set off, in the topic we're interested in, put together everything we can find related to the topic.

As a person who's interested in systematic programs, I went on and found a Chinese bullshit generator, which is a mockery new article generating tool for the user to create complete gibberish based on a few criteria (which this form of news happens more often than you think in China).

> This entire page of article was based on the topic "Study hardly". Everything else beside the phrase "Study hardly" were generated by the generator.

Also, as I probably spent more time than I should on the web, I contributed a Pewdiepie based chatbot to the chatbot slide. Quoting Pewdiepie himself:

> "Very nice."

> Just look at that beautiful Swidish meatball lmao





# Pre-Production

This week marks the beginning of our pre-production of the re-reading. 

We started by putting together keywords that can represent the aethetic of the *House of Leaves*, and all of our group members are filling in with their favourite film sequences.

We then brainstormed to come up with some big ideas - elements we would like to implement into our film, and started sum up the timeline of the introduction.

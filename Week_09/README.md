# Laying Down the First Brick

The first visual effect in my prototype I was trying to achieve is floating texts.

Researching codes on the Internet and the closest one to my interpretation is an example of Particle System on the P5.js website:

I got rid of the lines connecting the particle's first, and changed each dot into words. However, because my lack of knowledge in coding, after working all night, I still couldn't figure out how to fix the bug of texts flashing all the time. With help from code-master Finn (https://github.com/FinnArundel/codewordsRMIT) on the day of class, I was managed to have a presentable text cloud, with a bit of pseudo 3D effect I wanted to achieve.

After a good rest, I set-off first to learn exactly what those codes and the fixes meant.

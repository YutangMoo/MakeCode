# Paper Prototype V1

Extracted the essences from the OK Texts, and based on my interpretation, I "invented" a cruel sentence generator (in the Paper Prototype form).

I, used up all my brain juice, and had enough beer to sunk into a level of depression, wrote bunch of cruel and mean phrases and sentences, then tried to form them into whole statements. My writings are not as good as Marks, and here they are:

# Play with Sound

The legendary Karen returns and brought us a step-by-step session of how to implement audio into our codes.

It utilised a seperate library - P5.sound - which have the ability of analysing the feature of the sound that is pre-loaded, and make other element on the canvas react to it.

After the session, I only got the chance to remix the code a little and created this Ding wave, which activate whenever you click on the screen.

This practice is not only another showcase of what the P5.js is capable of, it's also a demonstration of how to combine user interaction with effects.
